    <h1>the monsters of âventiure</h1>
    <p>
      Since this version is still an early alpha, there is no monster compendium
      - yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a guide to creating monsters in âventiure, the following chapters
      describe a rough framework within which you can design your encounters.
    </p>

    <h2>stats</h2>
    <h3>level</h3>
    <p>
      The level of a monster determines all of its major stats, like health,
      number of actions per turn and the attack/defense levels. Generally
      meaning the higher the level of a monster, the more difficult it gets to
      defeat it.
    </p>

    <h3>tier</h3>
    <p>
      A monster can fall into different tiers. You can think of it from minion
      (tier 1) to boss (tier 5), but they are all from the same species.
      However, the tier of a monster only affects its health and not any other
      stats.
    </p>

    <h3>health</h3>
    <p>
      The health of a monster is being calculated by its base health, level and
      tier.
    </p>
    <code>base_health = 50</code>
    <code>level = X * d10-roll</code>
    <code>tier = Y * 25</code>
    <code>health = base_health + level + tier</code>

    <h2>combat</h2>
    <h3>actions</h3>
    <p>
      The number of acitons per turn for a monster are determined by its level.
      For example, a level 5 monster would have 5 actions per turn.
    </p>

    <h3>movement</h3>
    <p>
      Every monster has two movement actions, but they are also allowed to use
      their normal actions as a movement action.
    </p>

    <h3>attack and defence</h3>
    <p>
      A monster's attack and defence level is the same as the level of the
      monster. But the same action-decay rules apply here, meaning, that the
      attack level decrases with every actionin the same turn.
    </p>

    <h3>damage</h3>
    <p>
      The damage a monster can deal is the sum of rolled Xd10, where X is the
      level of the monster.
