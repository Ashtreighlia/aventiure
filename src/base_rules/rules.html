    <h1>the rules of âventiure</h1>
    <p>
      This is the basic set of rules for âventiure. Stick to them, modify them,
      or completely bend them to your will. Just have fun with the game, your
      creativity is the limit.
    </p>
    <h2 id="skills">skills</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike most rulesets, âventiure does not use predefined skills. The main
      focus is on developing your character over time. Just like in real life
      you can do anything - you might suck at it, but at least you can give it a
      try.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first skill owned by everyone, is <b>do a thing: 1</b> - meaning you
      can do anything as a level 1 action.
    </p>
    <p>
      When someone wants to do something, they and the game master (GM) roll
      their d10s and d10.0s dice (for a total of 1-100) to decide whether the
      player was successful. For example, if you want to open a LVL 1 lock with
      a LVL 1 lock picking skill, both roll once. However, if higher levels are
      involved, both roll as many times as they have levels in their "skill".
      The highest single roll of both parties counts. If the player wins, he
      manages to do whatever he wanted to do. However, if the GM wins, the
      player screws up his action. If there is a tie on the highest roll, the
      player succeeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a player rolls a repdigit (a 100 counts as a repdigit -> 00-0), he is
      granted a level up in whatever he was just trying to do. However he needs
      to throw as many repdigits as he made rolls, meaning, that for a level 3
      skill the player has to roll 3 repdigits in a row while performing his
      action to level up his skill.
    </p>
    <h3>tools</h3>
    <p>
      A player can find and use tools to get an edge over the GM. They increase
      the likely hood of them succeeding. For more information look up
      <a href="armoury.html">the armoury of âventiure</a>.
    </p>

      </table>
    </div>
    <h2 id="combat">combat</h2>
    <h3>initiative</h3>
    <p>
      The order in combat is determined by a d10 roll. If the GM and a player
      happen to roll the same value, the player goes first. However, if multiple
      players roll the same value, they can decide who goes first.
    </p>
    <h3>actions</h3>
    <p>
      Every player has 2 actions and 2 movement action in combat. They can use
      their actions however they want, but they cannot do the same action and
      skill level twice per turn. Attacking, casting a spell, using a skill or
      even using their normal actions as movement actions counts towards their
      overall used actions that turn. You can only use a particular skill level
      once per turn, which means that any subsequent actions must be made with
      the next lower skill level. This also applies to other skills, attack
      skills or spell skills in your turn, meaning that you should start with
      the highest skill level and work your way down from there.
    </p>
    <h3>movement</h3>
    <p>
      Every player can move 1 block per used movement action. As a measurement
      for distance you may choose any measurement system that fits your bill
      (should be around 1 meters, 3 feet or 60 barleycorn per block).
    </p>
    <h3>attack</h3>
    <p>
      Everyone can <b>attack a thing: 1</b>. Just like with the normal skills,
      you can attack anything you want, however you want, but don't expect to
      impress a dragon by hitting it with a rock. Here, as with a skill check,
      the attacker rolls their d10s and d10.0s (for a total of 1-100) according
      to their skill level for their attack and the defender rolls with their
      defence skill against the attackers roll. If the attacker wins, the target
      takes the damage described by their weapon. Otherwise the attacker has
      missed their target. As with the skills before, you increase your skill
      level by rolling repdigits.
    </p>
    <h3>defend</h3>
    <p>
      When defending, each player initially resorts to <b>defend a thing: 1</b>.
      This is the player's defence against an attack as described earlier in the
      paragraph attack. The ability improves by rolling repdigits for the type
      of armour used.

          </tr>
        </template>
      </table>
    </div>
    <h3>weapons and armour</h3>
    <p>
      By using better weapons and armour the player can get an advantage in
      combat. The damage of a weapon aswell as the defence of armour is
      determined by its quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information look up
      <a href="armoury.html">the armoury of âventiure</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="magic">magic</h2>
    <p>
      As in the previous chapters, spells also have skill levels. Each player
      knows a number of spells based on their class and race. They can cast all
      of these as level 1 spells. Every player has a certain amount of mana
      points according to their picked class and race. Casting a spell uses up
      one mana point, if you are out of mana points you cannot cast any more
      spells. Mana points can be refreshed by taking a rest or a mana potion.
    </p>
    <h3>spells</h3>
    <p>
      There are three different types of spells - attack, support and utility.
      Utility and support spells are cast against the worst d10 and d10.0 (for
      1-100) roll of the GM with the same amount of dice as the player has skill
      levels. Attack spells, on the other hand, are always rolled against the
      defence level of the attacked, the highest single roll counts. In the
      event of a tie, the attacked wins. The damage is determined by the wand
      used and the properties of the spell.
    </p>
    <h3>rituals</h3>
    <p>
      Unlike spells, rituals are not directl magical influences emanating from a
      being, but are rather created through concentration. Therefore, rituals do
      not require checks, but they can only be prepared during a rest. Depending
      on the choosen class and race a player can prepare multiple rituals per
      rest.

    <h2 id="characters">characters</h2>
    <p>
      Like any other TTRPG, âventiure also relies heavily on its characters.
    </p>
    <h3>classes and races</h3>
    <p>
      When creating a character, both their class and race are important for
      their traits. âventiure tries to keep the system relatively simple so as
      not to waste too much time (subsequent characters should therefore be
      relatively easy to create.. dying is part of the game ^^).
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information look up
      <a href="characters.html">the characters of âventiure</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>character level up</h3>
    <p>
      Levelling is mostly determined by the GM. As a rule of thumb you level up
      every 6 skill levels you learned as a character. A character level up
      grants you full health, mana points and can be regarded as a rest with a
      consumed ration. Additionally you gain a permanent 1d10 to your maximum
      health and one additional mana point. Every 2 character level ups you
      learn one new spell or ritual.
    </p>
    <h3>healing</h3>
    <p>
      Healing can be achieved in four different ways. Either by casting a heal
      spell, using a potion of healing (heals 1/4 of maximum HP) or treating
      your wounds. Treating woulds does 1d10 healing, if the skill check was
      successful. However, doing this will use all you actions of your turn in
      combat. Alernatively, you can take a rest with a consumed ration to fully
      heal yourself.
    </p>
    <h3>resting</h3>
    <p>
      You can take a rest at any time, but you should seek a safe place first to
      set up camp. A rest takes around 6 hours and refills all your mana points.
      If you have consumed a ration your health will be completely restored,
      this is optional, but highly recommended.
    </p>
    <h3>death</h3>
    <p>
      Dying is always such a thing. No one wants to, but someone has to. In
      âventiure, death is handled relatively simply. If you are at 0HP, you get
      unconscious. In âventiure you only die if an enemy attacks and hits you
      while you are unconscious. In order to revive a teammate you have to
      healing them, be it by treating their wounds, casting a healing spell or
      giving them a healing potion.
    </p>
    <h2 id="monster">monsters</h2>
    <p>
      Since âventiure is a very open game system, the monsters you use in your
      session are as freely inventable as the rest of the game. So go nuts! In
      the following, we will roughly go into the values such as health and
      actions per battle as well as attacks, damage and defence of monsters.
