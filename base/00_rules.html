    <h1>rules of prototype</h1>
    <h2>skills</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike most rulesets, prototype does not use predefined skills. The main
      focus is on developing your character over time. Just like in real life
      you can do anything - you might suck at it, but at least you can give it a
      try.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first skill owned by everyone, is <b>do a thing: 1</b> - meaning you
      can do anything as a level 1 action.
    </p>
    <p>
      someone wants to do something, they and the game master (GM) roll their
      d10s and d10.0s dice (for a total of 1-100) to decide whether the player
      was successful. For example, if you want to open a LVL 1 lock with a LVL 1
      lock picking skill, both roll once. However, if higher levels are
      involved, both roll as many times as they have levels in their "skill".
      The highest single roll of both parties counts. If the player wins, he
      manages to do whatever he wanted to do. However, if the GM wins, the
      player screws up his action. If there is a tie on the highest roll, the
      player wins.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a player throws a double, he is granted a level up in whatever he was
      just trying to do. However he needs to throw as many doubles as he made
      rolls, meaning, that for a level 3 skill the player has to roll 3 doubles
      in a row while performing his action to level up his skill.

    <h3>tools</h3>
    <p>
      A player can find and use tools to get an edge over the GM. They increase
      the likely hood of them succeeding. For more information look up the
      <a href="tools.html">armour, wands, weapons and tools of prototype</a>.
