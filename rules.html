    <h1>the rules of âventiure</h1>
    <p>
      This is the basic set of rules for âventiure. Stick to it, modify it, or
      completely bend it to your will. Just have fun with it, your creativity is the limit.
    </p>
    <h2 id="skills">skills</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike most rulesets, âventiure does not use predefined skills. The main
      focus is on developing your character over time. Just like in real life
      you can do anything - you might suck at it, but at least you can give it a
      try.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first skill owned by everyone, is <b>do a thing: 1</b> - meaning you
      can do anything as a level 1 action.
    </p>
    <p>
      someone wants to do something, they and the game master (GM) roll their
      d10s and d10.0s dice (for a total of 1-100) to decide whether the player
      was successful. For example, if you want to open a LVL 1 lock with a LVL 1
      lock picking skill, both roll once. However, if higher levels are
      involved, both roll as many times as they have levels in their "skill".
      The highest single roll of both parties counts. If the player wins, he
      manages to do whatever he wanted to do. However, if the GM wins, the
      player screws up his action. If there is a tie on the highest roll, the
      player wins.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a player throws a double, he is granted a level up in whatever he was
      just trying to do. However he needs to throw as many doubles as he made
      rolls, meaning, that for a level 3 skill the player has to roll 3 doubles
      in a row while performing his action to level up his skill.
    </p>
    <h3>tools</h3>
    <p>
      A player can find and use tools to get an edge over the GM. They increase
      the likely hood of them succeeding. For more information look up the
      <a href="armoury.html">armoury of âventiure</a>.
    </p>

      </table>
    </div>
    <h2 id="combat">combat</h2>
    <h3>initiative</h3>
    <p>
      The order in combat is determined by a d10 roll. If the GM and a player
      happen to roll the same value, the player goes first. However, if multiple
      players roll the same value, they can decide who goes first.
    </p>
    <h3>actions</h3>
    <p>
      Every player has 2 actions and 1 movement action in combat. They can use
      their actions however they want, but they cannot do the same action and
      skill level twice per turn. Attacking, casting a spell, using a skill or
      even using their normal actions as movement actions counts towards their
      overall used actions that turn. However, you can only use a particular
      skill level once per round, which means that any subsequent actions must
      be made with the next lower skill level. This also applies to other
      skills, attack skills or spell skills in this round, meaning that you
      should start with the highest skill level and work your way down from
      there.
    </p>
    <h3>movement</h3>
    <p>
      Every player can move 2 blocks per used movement action. As a measurement
      for distance you may choose any measurement system that fits your bill
      (should be around 1 meters, 3 feet or 60 barleycorn per block).
    </p>
    <h3>attack</h3>
    <p>
      Everyone can attack a thing: 1. Just like with the normal skills, you can
      attack anything you want, however you want, but don't expect to impress a
      dragon by hitting it with a rock. Here, as with a skill check, the
      attacker rolls their d10s and d10.0s (for a total of 1-100) according to
      their skill level for their attack and the defender rolls with their
      defence skill against the attackers roll. If the attacker wins, the target
      takes the damage described by their weapon. Otherwise the attacker has
      missed their target. As with the skills before, you increase your skill
      level by rolling doubles.
    </p>
    <h3>defend</h3>
    <p>
      When defending, each player initially resorts to defend a thing: 1. This
      is the player's defence against an attack as described earlier in the
      paragraph attack. The ability improves by rolling doubles for the type of
      armour used.
    </p>

        </template>
      </table>
    </div>
    <h3>weapons and armour</h3>
    <p>
      By using better weapons the attacker can add modifiers to their attack
      roll. Same goes for the defender by using better armour.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information look up the
      <a href="armoury.html">armoury of âventiure</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="magic">magic</h2>
    <p>
      As in the previous chapters, spells also have skill levels. Each player
      knows a number of spells based on their class and race. They can cast all
      of these as level 1 spells. Every player has a certain amount of mana
      points according to their picked class and race. Casting a spell uses up
      one mana point, if you are out of mana points you cannot cast any more
      spells. Mana points can be refreshed by taking a rest or a mana potion.
    </p>
    <h3>spells</h3>
    <p>
      There are three different types of spells - attack, support and utility.
      Utility and support spells are cast against the worst d10 and d10.0 (for
      1-100) roll of the GM with the same amount of dice as the player has skill
      levels. Attack spells, on the other hand, are always rolled against the
      defence level of the attacked, the highest single roll counts. In the
      event of a tie, the attacked wins. The damage is determined by the wand
      used and the properties of the spell.
    </p>
    <h3>rituals</h3>
    <p>
      Unlike spells, rituals are not directl magical influences emanating from a
      being, but are rather created through concentration. Therefore, rituals do
      not require checks, but they can only be prepared during a rest.

    <h2 id="character">character</h2>
    <p>
      Like any other TTRPG, âventiure also relies heavily on its characters. To
      simplify the creation of a character sheet for the players, one is already
      enclosed, what a service!
    </p>
    <h3>health</h3>
    <p>
      Every character starts out with a base health of 100hp. Health can be
      replenished by healing as a skill or as a spell. Resting heals you to the
      maximum, but you have to consume a ration while doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Healing can be achieved in three ways. Either by casting a heal spell,
      using a potion of healing (heals a quarter of your maximum HP) or aiding
      your wounds for +1d10, if the skill check was successful. Doing this will
      use all you actions.
    </p>
    <h3>classes and races</h3>
    <p>
      When creating a character, both the class and race are important for their
      traits. âventiure tries to keep the system relatively simple so as not to
      waste too much time (subsequent characters should therefore be relatively
      easy to create.. dying is part of the game ^^).
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information look up the
      <a href="character.html">people of âventiure</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>level up</h3>
    <p>
      Levelling is mostly determined by the GM. As a rule of thumb you level up
      every 6 skills you learned as a character. A level up grants you full
      health and mana points and can be regarded as a rest with consumed ration.
      Additionally you gain 1d10 HP on your maximum health, one more spell slot.
      Every 2 character level ups you learn one new spell.
    </p>
    <h3>resting</h3>
    <p>
      You can take a rest at any time, but you should seek a safe place first to
      set up camp. A rest takes around 4 hours and refills all your mana points.
      If you have consumed a ration your health will be completely restored,
      this is optional, but highly recommended.
    </p>
    <h3>death</h3>
    <p>
      Dying is always such a thing. No one wants to, but someone has to. In
      âventiure, death is handled relatively simply. If you are at 0HP, you are
      unconscious. In âventiure you only die if an enemy attacks and hits you
      while you are unconscious, the damage doesn't matter. So technically your
      teammates can keep you unconscious after a team fight, so you better be
      useful to them. You revive teammates by healing them.
    </p>
    <h2 id="monster">monster</h2>
    <p>
      Since âventiure is a very open game system, the monsters you use in your
      session are as freely inventable as the rest of the game. So go nuts! In
      the following, we will roughly go into the values such as health and
      actions per battle as well as attacks, damage and defence of monsters.
