## welcome to âventiure

Âventiure is a one-shot TTRPG ruleset for those who want to get a session going with very little time on their hands because somehow the stars aligned at the last minute and everyone would be up for a game tomorrow. But if you want to use this ruleset for a full-fledged campaign, no one will be able stop you, you lunatic.

If this has sparked your interest, then check it out at [aventiure.xyz](https://aventiure.xyz).
